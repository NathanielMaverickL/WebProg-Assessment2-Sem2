    <h2>About PvZ</h2>
    <p>
      Plants vs. Zombies (PVZ1) is a tower defense game developed by PopCap Games way back in 2009 that quickly became a cult classic for its quirky humor, strategic gameplay,
      and easier gaming style, making it interactive for both game itself and the user. In the game, players must protect their homes from storming zombies by strategically placing 
      varities of plants, each with their unique abilities and powers to take down a zombie, across the lawn, from sunflowers that providing and producing sun and energy to plants in
      able to defend the house from the approaching zombies, every plant plays a crucial role in the defensive lineup. As levels progress, the game introduces new environments such as
      rooftops, nighttime, foggy night, and even pool, making the challenge increased and keeping the gameplay fresh and exciting, it's the mix of casual play and tactical decision-making
      that made PVZ1 a favorite among gamers of all ages and solidified its place as one of the most iconic games of its generation.

    <h2>Mechanics</h2>
    <p><b>Goal:</b> Protect your house from waves of silly but dangerous zombies by planting cool plants that fight for you. If they reach your house, it's game over.</p>
    <p><b>Collect Sun:</b> Sun is the resource used to plant. It falls from the sky in day levels, and is produced by Sunflowers or Sun-shrooms in night levels.</p>
    <p><b>Choose & Plant Strategically:</b> Pick the right mix of attacking, blocking, exploding, and sun-generating plants. Spread them wisely across lanes.</p>
    <p><b>Watch the Lanes:</b> Zombies move straight down lanes. Each needs to be defended or they'll break through.</p>
    <p><b>Survive the Waves:</b> Levels end with massive zombie rushes. Be ready!</p>
    <p><b>Use Lawn Defenses:</b> Lawnmowers, pool cleaners, and roof cleaners will save you once per lane, but only once.</p>
